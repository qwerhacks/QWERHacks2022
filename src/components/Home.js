                        we're back and ready to hack!! qwer hacks at ucla is major league hacking's first LGBTQIA hackathon and aims to
                        increase the visibility of and celebrate the queer and trans community in STEM, as well as engage and
                        bring together queer individuals and allies through empowering tech talks, technical and 
                        community building workshops, and the development of innovative products meant to help

                        this year, in a space that celebrates identity, intersectionality, and community, we'd like you to create a future 
                        you want to see. we could live in a world where Black trans lives not only matter â€“ but thrive, non-binary 
                        individuals have access to inclusive and respectful healthcare, public policies work to make life easier 
                        for marginalized groups, our education system celebrates and uplifts underrepresented voices, and our diverse 
                        identities are reflected both on our screens and behind the scenes.
