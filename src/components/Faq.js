                  you can sign up as a team of up to four members. but make sure that all 
                  your team members submit an application! if you don’t have a team before the event,

                one of two ways, but both on tikkl! for streamed workshops, you can watch them in the same way you watched the keynote speeches. 
                for interactive workshops, a zoom link will be posted on tikkl! when it’s time for the workshop to start, click on the link and you can hop right in.
